# NonaCept JavaFX Components

Some JavaFX components for making your life easier
***
`nonacept.javafx.scene.layout.InternalWindow`: it's a component rather similar to `JInternalWindow` from Java Swing library.

It offers a JavaFX Node (in fact extends a Pane), and it can be added to another Parent, and have Content added to it. It will be shown as a Window inside your Window, it can be resized, moved, and etc.

I will offer some examples in the future, for now, sorry, but try to figure it out.
